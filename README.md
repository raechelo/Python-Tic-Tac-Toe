# Python-Tic-Tac-Toe ‚ùå‚≠ïÔ∏è

This tic tac toe is a basix exercise for me to get started with Python. üêç

### Learning Goals
To begin understanding Python syntax, specifically around tabbing, how to write methods, and how to run/use a Python app. This app is fully playable from the terminal, alternating turns between two players, just like the beloved game.

### Setup Instructions

- open in ~~VSCode~~ your favorite text editor
- in main.py, right click and choose 'run in terminal'
- enjoy!
